# Machine_learning_final_project
The following algorithms are used to build models for the different datasets: k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression.
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable: Jaccard index, F1-score, Log Loss.
